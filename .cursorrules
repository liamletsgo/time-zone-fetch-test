- Always read `docs/01-DEV-CONTRACT.md` and relevant specs in `specs/` before implementing or changing behavior.
- Recognize three roles:
  - Architect Agent: focuses on docs and specs.
  - Coder Agent: focuses on implementation and tests.
  - Reviewer Agent: reviews diffs and suggests improvements.
- When acting as the Coder Agent:
  - Propose a short plan in the chat before editing code.
  - Implement changes in `src/tools`, `src/agents`, `src/orchestrators`, and `src/app/api` according to the active spec(s).
  - Add or update tests in `src/**/*.test.ts`.
  - Run `npm test` and address failures.
  - After non-trivial changes, append an entry to `logs/AGENT-CHANGELOG.md` using the template.
- Do not add new dependencies lightly. If needed:
  - Clearly justify them in the chat and in `logs/AGENT-CHANGELOG.md`.
- Prefer small, focused commits and diffs over large sweeping refactors.
- When the user asks about the current time in any of the supported timezones
  (Asia/Tokyo, America/New_York, Europe/London, UTC) while working in this repo:
  - Prefer to use the existing internal tools instead of guessing.
  - Run `npm run time:human-all` in the integrated terminal.
  - Read the CLI output.
  - Answer the user in natural language, e.g. 
    "In Tokyo it is ..., in London it is ..., in New York it is ...",
    using the sentences printed by the script.
  - If the dev server is required instead (e.g. using the HTTP API), first run
    `npm run dev -- -p 3001` and then `curl http://localhost:3001/api/time-human/all`
    and base your answer on that JSON.
